# Pushover Notifications for Transmission in Docker (Linux)

This script sends a Pushover notification whenever a torrent finishes downloading in a Transmission container on a Linux system. It runs on the host and is triggered by Transmission's post-download hook using environment variables provided by the container.

## üì¶ Features

- Sends notifications via [Pushover](https://pushover.net)
- Includes torrent name, save path, and hostname
- Runs on any Linux system with Docker
- Simple log output to `/var/log/pushover`

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Linux system running Transmission in Docker
- Pushover account with a registered application
- `curl` installed on the host system

2. **Get your User Key** from the dashboard after logging in.
3. **Create a new application** at [https://pushover.net/apps/build](https://pushover.net/apps/build)

2. **Mount the script into the Transmission container**

If using `docker run`:
